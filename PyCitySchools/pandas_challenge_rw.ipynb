    "# PyCity Schools Analysis (High Level)\n",
    "* Below are the two most important trends from my personal analysis on the data. \n",
    "    1. The smaller the school size, the better the students perform across all metrics used for this study. If one combines type of school to this equation performance goes up even more. Students at small, charter schools perform the best.\n",
    "    2. Going against what some may seem as sound education policy, as spending per student goes up, student performance goes down. Spending more money to create better outcomes for students doesn't seem to be the correct route.\n",
    "* Each subsection of analysis below also has some more detailed findings which contributed to the above high level points\n",
    "* If further insights were needed from the data, a next best step might be to use visualization along with more robust statistics to evaluate possible trends"

    "* Total School Budgets can vary widely (millions) as can the size of student populations. Therefore these metrics should not be looked at in a vacuum and metrics like Per Student Budget should be given more weight when analyzing spending affects on academic outcomes.\n",
    "* As in the District Summary, the average metrics don't vary too much from subject to subject and school to school, approximately in the range of 76 - 83. On the other hand, the % passing metrics vary widely, especially in math and overall passing. This once again begs the question of whether average is a good indicator of academic performance for our schools. More statistics are needed to test this assumption."
